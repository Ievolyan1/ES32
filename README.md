Before using this code, you need to replace "YourWiFiSSID" and "YourWiFiPassword" with your actual Wi-Fi network credentials. Additionally, replace "YOUR_CHANNEL_ID" and "YOUR_API_KEY" with your YouTube channel ID and YouTube API key respectively.

Please note that this code makes a request to the YouTube API every minute. Please be aware of the rate limits imposed by the YouTube API to avoid exceeding the maximum number of requests per unit of time.

Also, make sure to add the WiFi.h and HTTPClient.h libraries to your Arduino IDE if they are not already installed.
